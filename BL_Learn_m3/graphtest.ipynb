It uses a linear equation to model this relationship, making it a valuable tool for understanding relationships between variables and making predictions in various applications. The linear regression equation is typically represented as Y = β0 + β1X + ε, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β0 is the intercept or constant term, β1 is the slope coefficient, and ε is the error term. The cost function for linear regression is usually measured using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which calculates the average difference between predicted and actual values. However, linear regression has its limitations, such as assuming linearity and being sensitive to multicollinearity, which occurs when there is a high correlation between independent variables. Despite these limitations, linear regression has been widely used for many years due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency. It is commonly used for predicting continuous outcomes, such as predicting house prices based on features like number of rooms, location, and size, or predicting stock prices based on historical data and market trends. In e-commerce sales analysis, linear regression can be used to assess how various factors such as product price, marketing promotions, and seasonal trends impact sales. In agricultural practices, linear regression can be used to analyze the relationship between variables like rainfall, temperature, soil quality, and fertilizer usage to optimize productivity. To implement linear regression, it is essential to prepare the data, split it into training and testing sets, and then use a machine learning library or software package to train the model and make predictions. The model can be evaluated using metrics such as coefficient of determination (R-squared), MSE, and MAE, and can be improved by feature engineering, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning.'], 'pages_completed': [], 'question': [], 'correct_answer': [], 'user_input': []}\n"
